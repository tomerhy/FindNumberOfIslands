# FindNumberOfIslands

Given a boolean 2D matrix, find the number of islands. A group of connected 1s forms an island. For example, the below matrix contains 5 islands

Example: 

Input : mat[][] = {{1, 1, 0, 0, 0},
                   {0, 1, 0, 0, 1},
                   {1, 0, 0, 1, 1},
                   {0, 0, 0, 0, 0},
                   {1, 0, 1, 0, 1}}
Output : 5
This is a variation of the standard problem: “Counting the number of connected components in an undirected graph”. 

Before we go to the problem, let us understand what is a connected component. A connected component of an undirected graph is a subgraph in which every two vertices are connected to each other by a path(s), and which is connected to no other vertices outside the subgraph. 
For example, the graph shown below has three connected components.
